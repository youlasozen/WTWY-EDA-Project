<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 About The Project </h3>

- 🔭 &nbsp; We received an e-mail from Karrine & Dahlia.
- 📩 &nbsp; Dear Ulas,

     It was very nice to meet and chat with you at the event where we just met and had a nice chat. We would love to take the next steps together to see if working together makes sense for both parties.

     As we mentioned, we want to leverage the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of street teamwork, which is an important part of our fundraising efforts.

     Our WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) association organizes an annual gala every year at the beginning of the summer season. As we are a new and inclusive organization, we strive to do double duty with gala to both fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing women's participation in technology and at the same time create awareness and reach.

     For this purpose, we place street teams at the entrances of metro stations. Street teams collect the e-mail addresses of the people they can reach and send free tickets to our gala to those who register.

     Where we want to ask you for help is to use MTA metro data, which I'm sure you know is available free of charge from the city, to help us optimize the layout of our street crews so we can reach as many people as can attend the gala and contribute to our cause.

     We will be eagerly awaiting the results of your work as soon as possible.

     Sincerely,

     Karrine & Dahlia

     WTWY International.


<h3> When i solve this; </h3>

-  &nbsp; I found a huge dataset about turnstile in <a href="https://new.mta.info/open-data">this</a> link!,
-  &nbsp; Finding the most popular New York streets,  
-  &nbsp; Classification according to human traffic,
-  &nbsp; Crowd and time analysis,
-  &nbsp; Finding and deducing the results.

<h4> and also i followed this approach; </h4>

-  &nbsp; Since it will be held in the summer, it was decided that May 2022 would be the most reasonable,  
-  &nbsp; Only the year 2022 was looked at, as data from the time of the corona virus were thought to distort the accuracy,
-  &nbsp; It was decided to find the 7 most crowded stations,
-  &nbsp; Data collected from each turnstile was processed based on hour, station and human traffic.
